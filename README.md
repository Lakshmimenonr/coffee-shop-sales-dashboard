This dashboard provides a detailed overview of the sales performance across the three coffee stores locations. The objective is to optimize store operations, enhance profitability, and streamline resource management, based on data-driven insights. Here we have used the help of excel to create tables and charts.

Key Insights:
1. Revenue Growth:
•	Positive Growth: We’ve seen consistent revenue growth across the stores, indicating rising popularity.
•	Peak in May: A significant revenue increase in May and June was observed, possibly due to the holiday season or customer behaviour trends. This could be a critical period for boosting sales further.
•	Actionable Insight: Plan for increased promotions and product launches during this period next year to capitalize on the peak in customer visits.
2. Busiest Days and Hours:
•	Peak Days: The busiest days across all locations are Monday, Thursday, and Friday—likely driven by customer traffic as they begin their workweek and prepare for the weekend.
•	Peak Hours: The morning hours, specifically 7 AM to 10 AM, see the highest number of customers, coinciding with the morning rush and commuter traffic.
•	Recommendation: Adjust staffing levels to ensure quick service and product availability during these hours and days. Consider offering morning-specific promotions like discounts on espresso or coffee-based combos.
3. Top Products:
•	Barista Espresso remains the top-selling product across all stores, reaffirming its popularity.
•	Coffee Category Dominates: Coffee remains the core category driving revenue. Specialty drinks such as espresso continue to attract the highest sales.
•	Actionable Insight: Consider creating bundles or combo deals (e.g., espresso + pastry) to increase average transaction values during busy hours.
4. Underperforming Products:
•	Flavored Coffees & Coffee Beans: These items consistently underperform across stores, with some flavors showing low sales.
•	Hell's Kitchen: Merchandise (such as clothing) at Hell’s Kitchen is particularly underperforming compared to other stores.
•	Recommendation: Consider discontinuing certain underperforming coffee products or offering discounts to move inventory. For Hell’s Kitchen, consider removing slow-moving merchandise from the store’s display and switching it to online-only orders to reduce operational costs.
Actionable Strategies Moving Forward:
1.	Leverage May & Holiday Surges: Prepare in advance for revenue surges during May and the holidays by ensuring that popular products are stocked up and staff levels are increased.
2.	Customize Marketing for Hell's Kitchen: Run promotions or provide discount offers to increase the sales of underperforming merchandise at Hell's Kitchen.
3.	Optimize Product Selection: Remove slow-moving products or promote them heavily through targeted discounts.
4.	Increase Efficiency in Busy Hours: Prepare for high traffic during peak hours (7 AM-10 AM) by adjusting staffing and product availability.
Data Story:
This dashboard provides a clear view of store performance, customer behavior, and product trends across all three Starbucks locations. With steady revenue growth, identifiable peak periods, and top-selling products, there is strong potential to further optimize operations. By addressing underperforming products, aligning resources with customer demand, and capitalizing on seasonal trends, the stores can drive higher efficiency and profitability. These insights will support informed decision-making and help guide future strategies for continued growth.
